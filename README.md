🌟 **Hello and Welcome!** 🌟

I'm a geoscience researcher. My current research focuses on exploring various geological processes to understand how they shape the Earth's surface and subsurface, and how they impact the quality and availability of natural resources.

## **Current Research Interests**:

- ⛏️ **Field-based geology and mineral exploration.**
- 🌍 **Interdisciplinary approaches to critical mineral resources.**
- 🏔️ **Sedimentary processes and their impacts on critical mineral distributions.**
- 💎 **Characteristics of sediment-hosted minerals.**
